## Introduction

This repository is designed as a personal playground for data science skill sharpening. It includes code from online courses, data analysis projects, and machine learning experiments.

## Folder Structure

Here's an overview of the main folders in this repository:

- **courses/**: Contains practice code based on various data science courses I've taken.
- **data-analysis/**: Includes projects and scripts focused on data exploration, visualization, and analysis.
- **ml/**: Dedicated to machine learning projects, including model implementation, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Courses

In the **courses/** folder, you'll find:

- Subfolders for each course, named according to the course title or topic.
- Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and notes from lessons and assignments.

## Data Analysis

The **data-analysis/** folder includes:

- Projects and scripts that involve cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data.
- Real-world datasets used for analysis, with a focus on deriving insights and creating visual stories.

## Machine Learning (ML)

The **ml/** folder features:

- Machine learning projects, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- Examples of learning algorithms, such as regression, classification, clustering, etc.
